# Documentation setup

The documentation for Dareplane is generated with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and [quartodoc](https://machow.github.io/quartodoc). The later is used to automatically generate API documentation for python modules. [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) uses a central `_quarto.yml` file to configure the documentation.


## TODO

- [ ] Currently the `Home` section is sourced from the `main.qmd` file as directly including the `README.md` did not work. As I could not get the logo to work properly (neither could I just ignore). The basic idea was from the [quarto docs](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/includes.html).
  -> the problems is simply that quarto did non load the logo for the dark theme... check once I added theming properly
